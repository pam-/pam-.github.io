Fitness challenges start now!
On this first one, my goal is to do 100 double-unders, unbroken, in one minute. I am giving myself 30 days. I am _hoping_ that it'll be enough.

## The rules

* I will have 5 one-minute attempts.
* I will record each attempt with a count.
* Every Friday until the last day of the challenge, I will try to beat the challenge and do the 5 attempts. This will help with tracking progress more than anything.
* _If_ I beat the challenge before the end of the 30 days, I'll add 50 double-unders to the count. If I beat that, I'll add 50 more and so on.

## What is a double-under

## Current status

How many double-unders can I do unbroken in a minute at the beginning of the challenge?


Wish me luck!
