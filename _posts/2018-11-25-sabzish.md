![comfort in a bowl: spinach sabzi][1]
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Spinach sabzi(ish)</p>

I've been feeling a bit manic lately. My brain is struggling to reconcile the avalanche of new creative ideas with the cold weather, shorter days, and end of the year fatigue. I yearn to lie down on my rug, wrap myself up in a blanket, turn Netflix on, and just stay there. For hours. With some tortilla chips and lots of stew. Don't judge me and my mixing of foods.

Anyways speaking of stew, some coworkers and I visited this Afghani restaurant a few weeks ago during a work onsite. As you can imagine, the menu was full of stews, vegetable dishes, grilled meats, and stuffed doughs. It was so delicious that I went again twice in that same week. One dish that stood out each visit was their spinach sabzi: a beautifully fragrant spinach stew that warmed my core and tickled my senses. On top of that, because my people have a similar dish, it brought me back to growing up in West Africa.

Since I was feeling particularly unhinged last night, I figured that this stew would help me gain some groundedness. I don't claim to have succeeded at making an exact Afghani sabzi, hence the title of this recipe, but this version of mine is pretty fucking delicious. It is rich, spicy, creamy, tangy, smoky, and just _good_. It is also very simple to make. Read below for ingredients and instructions:


#### the ingredients
```
- 1 tbspn of coriander
- 1 tbspn of cumin
- 1 tspn of cinnamon
- 1/2 tspn of turmeric
- 1/2 tspn of cayenne
- juice of 1 big lemon
- 2 tblspn of ghee and olive oil for cooking
- 1 box of baby spinach (i get the biggest box at WF)
- 1/2 yellow onion, roughly chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
```

#### the steps
```
- Put the oil and ghee in a large pot before putting it on medium-high heat.
- Add the spices to the pot, stir, and let it heat up for a few minutes. The fat and heat will bring out their flavors.
- When the fragrance starts to grow stronger, add the lemon juice and stir.
- Add the spinach, stir it so that all the leaves get in contact with the seasoned liquid.
- Reduce the heat to a low-medium temperature and cover the pot.
- Let it cook for about 20 minutes, making sure to stir regularly.
- The spinach will grow really soft and creamy in consistency.
- When the spinach has darkened, uncover the pot. If there is too much liquid for your liking, let some of the water evaporate.
