## ##00: Building a Youtube Channel

#### Making the decision

Out of all the 129928844e10 ideas I have, one kept coming back to my mind: starting a food oriented Youtube channel. I am protecting the exact idea until I finish producing the first season, but I am coming clean about the project and will be transparent about my process, my learnings, findings, etc...

My goal is to launch my channel at the end of January 2019. I honestly just decided this as I was typing... but I think it makes sense: the noise and high caused by the new year will have died down a little bit, at least just enough to give room to new projects, it'll be Black History Month, a great occasion to drop the project in creative channels and get featured. It overall feels like a good time to drop something new. Until then, there's a _LOT_ to be figured out.

#### Logistical deets

- **Name:** •••••••
- **Theme:** Cooking / Storytelling
- **Frequency:** Once a Week
- **Season Length**: 8 episodes
- **Length of standard episode:** 8 to 10minutes
- **Main Inspiration:** Bon Appetit's Test kitchen, Binging with Babish.

Today, is Thursday November 29th. I have about 2 months before I launch the first season (8 episodes). That means that on average, I must record, edit, and finalize 1 episode a week until launch. Taking into account the upcoming 3 weeks of holiday travels, that shortens it to about 2 episodes a week. :grimacing: :sweat_smile:. It's definitely doable! But there's no time for doubt, indecisiveness, and procrastination.

Without further ado, let's just jump into the updates.

#### Update 1

I ordered a [new tripod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XC3GWU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and some [softbox lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E4YS2XU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I'm still shopping around for a camera but also debating whether I should shoot with my phone. I'm leaning more and more towards _no_ because I want the content to look as crisp as I can afford. That said, while I do my googles, I am practicing recording with my phone.

I switched to using [ProMovie](http://promovieapp.com/) ($2.99 in the App store) this morning and after a first try, I like it! The UI makes things pretty straight forward: I'm able to set the white balance, the ISO, the exposure, and shutter speed. It also records in 4k automatically which, according to all the pros, is great and makes for better quality videos.

To practice composition, storyboarding, recording, and editing, I am producing content for my small fitness IG account [@myfitnesspam](https://www.instagram.com/myfitnesspam/). Because it's so small, there are no expectations, I can try different things and get immediate feedback. It's a great playground for what I'm trying to do: learn. I'm recording myself doing quick workouts at home, then having fun with editing. The goal is to gain proficiency in video production and make most of my mistakes on [@myfitnesspam](https://www.instagram.com/myfitnesspam/) instead of on the channel.

**Things I've done**

- Draft storyboard.
- Decided on first dish.
- Compiled list of all dishes for the season (might change things up, though).

**Things I have to do**

- buy a camera (I already have an SD card. Just have to find it...).
- buy an external hard drive (or find one).
- maybe a directional mic?? or use my Yeti mic, tbh. It may add some sort of character to it. I hope. Let's see.
- finalize my storyboarding. I have a pretty final draft done already but it might change a bit as I record, which is to be expected.
- record first trial with simple dish.


Be back soon with more updates!
