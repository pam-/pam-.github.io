## ##01: Spend $$$ for a camera or stick with what I have?

<!-- placeholder for video -->

#### Things I said I'd do
_this is list is coming from my previous [update][previous-update]_

**buy a camera (I already have an SD card. Just have to find it...).**

I did _not_ buy a camera.

I wrestled with the idea for hours, I watched a lot of youtube reviews, read a lot of articles on [The Verge][], [TechRadar][], and any other website, blog, newspaper, you name it, that would show up when I'd google a camera name with "reviews". It ultimately became more overwhelming than anything. I went to Best Buy last night, ignoring the nerves and set on getting something, _anything_, that had good video quality (4k was my target), and would let me customize the settings as much as I understood them. Luckily for my wallet, they didn't have any Sony products (my mind was veering towards the Sony a7iii and the a7sii). They had a few Canon options, though, which I played with. I enjoyed the 80D a lot, especially with its pricepoint but as soon as a clerk came to ask me if I needed help, my armpits started to sweat, I got shortness of breath, I _almost_ went full on panic attack. Something about this move wasn't sitting right with my body. So I went home instead, locking the cameras I liked in memory.

By the time I went home, I was still thinking about which camera to get but I had to put it aside because I had scheduled to shoot a trial video with my phone and my current light setup. Keep reading for deets about how it went.


**buy an external hard drive (or find one).**

I have a hard drive sitting in my closet.

**maybe a directional mic?? or use my Yeti mic, tbh. It may add some sort of character to it. I hope. Let's see.**

I already have a Yeti and a lavalier microphone. So I really don't _need_ extra mics, although it would be nice. Maybe later.

**finalize my storyboarding. I have a pretty final draft done already but it might change a bit as I record, which is to be expected.**

I did that. Better yet, I completely flipped my original idea and went for something else. Which takes me to the last item on my to do list:

**record first trial with simple dish.**

I recorded myself and honestly, the content itself wasn't too bad. I am friendly and outgoing in this strange, awkward, but cute way. So the character part is on lock. Everything else, though? NOT AT ALL.
- The lighting was awful: too bright, too cold, too much.
- I had not prepared my environment. The background was messy, my phone wasn't charged all the way so it died halfway during the recording. I had to add an extrernal charger to my, already janky, setup.
- Poor comoposition. I started with a decent composition: my cooking setup was in the center of the frame, lines were horizontal, etc... But then after my phone died and I had to panic-plug it to another charger, I put the phone back onto the tripod without checking the screen (ROOKIE MISTAKE. I'M A NOOB.) and it's only after I finished recording that I noticed that the horizon line was now tilted. SMH.
- When trying to edit the 4k footage, Premiere laughed at me and froze multiple times. Youtube was again a dear friend and helped me out but ultimately I had to take a major loss. The bad footage wasn't worth the time and effort.

This told me one thing: I need to invest my time in learning composition, better storyboarding, put an emphasis on b-roll for more compelling storytelling, and learn more about post-production. I should _not_ be wasting precious time and energy debating whether I should get the hot new camera when I would most certainly _still_ produce crap work.

So here we are, I'm choosing my iPhones (my current 8 and my old 5) and iPad to record all the things.

#### What I need to do

- record another trial video with my iphone on the most basic of settings and share, ask for feedback
- record and edit some short workout shots for mfp (practice, practice, practice)
- enroll in premiere pro course on udemy or something

Until next update :v:
