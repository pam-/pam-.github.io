## PB&G Brownies
_best eaten warm with ice cream, or cooled down and dunked into a warm glass of milk_

![brownies close up][2]

#### Equipment

- 9x13 baking sheet or pan (change in size is fine but will make for longer or shorter cooking time)
- Electric mixer or a really strong arm
- Small cooking pan
- Glass heat resistant bowl or measuring cup
- Grater

#### Ingredients

- 160g of bittersweet chocolate, 70% cocoa or more (I used chocolate discs)
- 33g of cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons of cinnamon

- 112g of ghee
- 122g of coconut oil
- 1 can of coconut condensed milk

- 1 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 6 eggs
- 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons of salt

- 30g of fresh grated ginger
- 1 cup of all purpose flour
- 1/4 cup of peanut butter


#### Steps

<ol>
	<ul> Preheat oven to 350ËšF </ul>
	<ul> In a small pan, melt ghee and coconut oil on medium heat for 10 minutes. </ul>
	<ul> While the oils are melting and conversing, put all the chocolate in a heat resistant glass bowl or measuring cup. Reserve. </ul>
	<ul> Grease a 9x13 pan, and line with parchment paper. </ul>
	<ul> Take the oils off the heat and pour on the chocolate. Let sit 2 minutes, then mix until all the chocolate is melted. </ul>
	<ul> Add the condensed milk to the hot chocolate. Mix until melted. Reserve.</ul>
	<ul> In a large bowl, add the salt, sugar, vanilla extract, and eggs. Beat with the electric mixer (or your ultra strong arm) until the texture gros in thickness and fluffiness. It will look like a batter with lots of bubbles.</ul>
	<ul> With the mixer still beating, add the cooled chocolate to the fluffy batter and mix until the chocolate is fully incorporated.</ul>
	<ul>  </ul>
</ol>
- 
- In a bowl, mix the melted ghee, the almond milk, and the coconut cream until smooth
- Add the egg yolks, mix until smooth
- Add the dry mix, mix until smooth
- Add the chocolate discs and ginger, stir it up
- Grease a 9x9 pan (or whatever size is recommended on the brownie mix pack). You can also use parchment paper.
- Pour in half the batter, even it out
- Add the cookies, evenly spaced out
- Cover the cookies with the rest of the batter, making sure that it is evenly poured around the pan
- Bake for 25 to 30 minutes
- Let cool, cut, and enjoy!

_Pro-tip: You can wrap the brownie pieces in saran wrap and freeze them once they're cool. Freezing them traps the moisture so the gooey texture stays the same. You can keep them in there for a couple of weeks! To eat, simply thaw (or warm up in a microwave) and enjoy._
