## Brownies with Ginger & PB Cookies
_best eaten warm with ice cream, or cooled down and dunked into a warm glass of milk_

![brownies close up][2]

#### Ingredients

- Brownie Mix (good for experiments because the dry tings are already perfectly measured)
- 3 egg yolks
- 5.4 fl oz of coconut cream (tiny can from Whole Foods)
- 2 tablespoons of ghee (melted and cool)
- 1/3 cup of almond milk
- about 2 tablespoons of fresh grated ginger
- peanut butter sandwich cookies (Oreos or other similar brands)
- 1/3 cup of dark chocolate discs

#### Steps

- Preheat oven to 350ËšF
- In a bowl, mix the melted ghee, the almond milk, and the coconut cream until smooth
- Add the egg yolks, mix until smooth
- Add the dry mix, mix until smooth
- Add the chocolate discs and ginger, stir it up
- Grease a 9x9 pan (or whatever size is recommended on the brownie mix pack). You can also use parchment paper.
- Pour in half the batter, even it out
- Add the cookies, evenly spaced out
- Cover the cookies with the rest of the batter, making sure that it is evenly poured around the pan
- Bake for 25 to 30 minutes
- Let cool, cut, and enjoy!

_Pro-tip: You can wrap the brownie pieces in saran wrap and freeze them once they're cool. Freezing them traps the moisture so the gooey texture stays the same. You can keep them in there for a couple of weeks! To eat, simply thaw (or warm up in a microwave) and enjoy._
