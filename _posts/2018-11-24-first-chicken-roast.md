I woke up this morning with one goal: roasting a whole chicken. And goodness, _I did that_.

This was my first time stuffing _anything_ besides my belly. I was pumped, a little nervous, but overall determined to make this happen.
I was in the mood for something spicy, juicy, and comforting, which in my mind implied stuffing. The deal was settled; I wasn't going to just roast a chicken, I was also going to stuff it! This was almost as exciting as seeing Big Nasty in Creed II, a movie I highly recommend. But anyways, I digress. I stepped into Whole Foods bright and early, with the Jade and XD podcast in my ears. I perused the store, got my merch and made my way back home, eager to get this party started.

I am _SO_ proud of the final product! I didn't make traditional stuffing and instead used chickpeas, purple sweet potato, and shredded carrots as my starches. The result was a delicious golden chicken, tender, very juicy meat (black _and_ white), and a spicy, peppery, and comforting filling.

Check out the recipe below for what I'll call **The Peppery Juicy Chicken**.


#### the ingredients

**for the chicken...**

![1][1]
```
- A whole free range organic chicken
```

**for the marinade**

![2][2]
```
- 2/3 cup of mayo
- juice of 1/2 a lime
- 1 tsp of ghee
- 1 tsp of ginger
- 1/2 tsp of coarse salt (or to taste)
- 1/2 tsp of ground peppercorn
```

**for the stuffing**

![7][7]
```
- 1 can of garbanzo beans
- 2 tbspn of whole peppercorns
- a handful of shredded carrots
- 1 tbspn of cumin
- juice of 1/2 a lime
- 2 tspn of ghee
- 1 cup of cooked sweet potato (i used some leftover purple sweet potato i roasted for a pie. Recipe dropping soon.)
```

![4][4]
```
- one shallot
- one little red onion (i found this cute little gal at WF)
```

**for extra aromas**

![6][6]
```
- fresh rosemary and thyme
- 3 garlic cloves
```

#### the steps

```
- preheat the oven to 450˚F.
- take the chicken out of its package and put it in a large mixing bowl.
- in a bowl, mix all the marinade ingredients. Taste it. Add salt and pepper as needed.
- using a brush, or your gloved hands, coat the chicken with the marinade, cover it, and let sit for about an hour.
```

```
- take the garbanzo beans out of the can, rinse them, and soak them in water. Let it soak.
- chop the shallot and red onion in little dice
- sautée it in a bit of butter (or the fat of your choice), season with salt and a pinch of sugar to help it caramelize faster (I use coconut sugar).
- once the onion get a little color on them, take them off the heat and let cool.
```
![5][5]

```
- mix the stuffing ingredients with the onions.
- drop it into a food processor (or the blender of your choice, a mortar... whatever works) and turn the mix into a chunky purée.
```
I FORGOT TO CAPTURE THIS STEP. MY BAD.

```
- get the bird out of the fridge and lay it chest up onto a baking pan or sheet.
- put the herbs and smashed garlic cloves inside the bird
- stuff if with the chickpea purée
- tie the legs together if you have rope (i didn't and nothing exploded)
- pop the bird in the oven for an hour
```
I ALSO FORGOT TO CAPTURE THIS STEP. MY BAD, AGAIN.

```
- after an hour, take the bird out and baste it with the liquid in the pan.
- put it back in the oven for 10 more minutes
- check on it by either:
  - using a meat thermometer and inserting it into the thickest part of the thigh (it should be at 165°)
  - cutting a piece of the thigh and ensuring there's no blood
- if it's not done, put it back in there!
- keep checking every 5 minutes until fully cooked. Don't blame me for your salmonella.
```

Et voila! _The Peppery Juicy Chicken_:
