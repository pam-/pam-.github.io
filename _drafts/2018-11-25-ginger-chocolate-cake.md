It's Sunday, which means that the delightful long holiday weekend is coming to an end, along with all the sweets treats and really productive days spent working on this blog while playing Netflix movies in the background. I finished the Final Table (didn't love it) and stumbled upon a French dark comedy titled "Le Jeu" that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. To close of the wonderful times spent with family, friends, and my new lover Big Nasty, I made some gingery chocolate cake sans frosting that I basically handled like brownies. The result was a consistency merging the fudgy texture of a regular brownie and the light fluffiness of a cake. Happy middle for sure.

I used a gluten free chocolate brownie mix and added some crushed ginger snaps, ginger powder, and other fun spices to it. It was delicious, especially paired with a glass of warm almond milk. Once I get all the kitchen tools required for higher levels of baking, I'll make this cake again with chocolate honey frosting layers, and a honey lemon ginger coating. I imagine that a light touch of lemon will bring the right amount of tartness to cut through the rich chocolate and the ginger heat.

Stay tuned! In the meantime, here's the recipe:

dry ingredients:
2 cups of crushed ginger snaps
1 tablespoon of ginger pouder
pinch of salt
1/2 tspoon of cardamom
1/2 tspn all spice
2 oz of chopped dark chocolate
1 box of chocolate cake mix

wet ingredients:
5.4 fl oz of cocnut cream (tiny can from WF)
2 egg yolks
4 large eggs
1 cup of almond milk


instructions
0- Preheat oven at 350ËšF
1- mix the wet ingredients
2- mix the dry ingredients
3- add the dry to the wet and stir until the dry mix is fully incorporated. I'm using a GF mix so i could mix ad nauseam but if you're not, don't overmix or else the gluten will be too developed and your chocolate bites will be hella tough. Thanks to Paul (bae), Prue, and Mary Berry for teaching me this.
4- Oil a pan (i'm using a 9x13 sheet but you can use any pan recommended on your cake mix)
5- Put the batter in the pan
6- Bake for 20-25minutes or until a fork comes out clean when you poke the cake

ENJOY!!!
